        <p class="bio">
          An English computer scientist who created the World
          Wide Web (WWW), which dramatically changed the way
          information is shared globally. He was born on June 8,
          1955, in London, England. Tim developed the first web
          browser, the HTTP protocol, and the HTML markup
          language, which became the foundation of the modern
          Internet.
